# Getting Setup For The workshop

This entire workshop will run in the browser - so we are leveraging the Mana Open OnDemand enviornment and interactice Jupyter notebook session.

## Get Jupyter Setup for the workshop

Login to Mana at https://mana.its.hawaii.edu and from the menu select  "interactive app" and choose a jupyter notebook.  The default form fields will work for this workshop - if in the future you need more time or resources you can adjust.

##### Starting the notebook on Mana
After launching the interactive jupyter notebook application you will see your "interactive job" with a status of starting.

Once the job is running on a compput node a button will appear for you to click which will then open a browser tab with your running jupyter session.

We can start a terminal session by clicking on "New" (right hand side) as shown on the Figure below:

With the terminal session running we can proceed to the Git exercises.
